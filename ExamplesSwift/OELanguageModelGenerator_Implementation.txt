In offline speech recognition, you define the vocabulary that you want your app to be able to recognize. This is called a language model or grammar (you can read more about these options in the OELanguageModelGenerator documentation). A good vocabulary size for an offline speech recognition app on the iPhone, iPod or iPad is between 10 and 1000 words. This is an example of a language model; examples of a grammar can be found in the documentation.
