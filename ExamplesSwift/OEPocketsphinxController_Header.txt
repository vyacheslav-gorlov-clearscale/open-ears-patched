<p>To use OEPocketsphinxController, the class which performs speech recognition, you need a language model and a phonetic dictionary for it. These files define which words OEPocketsphinxController is capable of recognizing. We just created them above by using OELanguageModelGenerator. You also need an acoustic model. OpenEars ships with an English model and has several other acoustic models for different languages <a href="http://www.politepix.com/languages/">here</a>.</p>
