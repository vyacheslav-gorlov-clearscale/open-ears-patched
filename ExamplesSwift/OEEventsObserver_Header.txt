OEEventsObserver is the class which keeps you continuously updated about the status of your listening session, among other things, via delegate callbacks.


class ViewController: UIViewController, OEEventsObserverDelegate {
    
    var slt = Slt()
    var openEarsEventsObserver = OEEventsObserver()
    
    
Add the OEEventsObserverDelegate protocol to your class declaration at the top of your file, for instance if your class is called ViewController and its class declaration looks like this:<br>
<pre>
class ViewController: UIViewController {
</pre>

change it to look like this:<br>

<pre>
class ViewController: UIViewController, OEEventsObserverDelegate {
</pre>

At the beginning of your (for instance, ViewController) class, add the following var:

<pre>
var openEarsEventsObserver = OEEventsObserver()
</pre>

</pre>
